I'm Dr Rob Lang and I am a programmer. I code in .NET, Javascript and React (a bit). I have coded in Syntel, LISP, C, C++. I've worked in lots of domains including finance, life sciences, human resources and currently healthcare.

My PhD is in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Reading, where I invented the Plastic Self Organising Map. My AI interests are in novelty detection in non-stationary environments and networks whose neuronal topologies change.
