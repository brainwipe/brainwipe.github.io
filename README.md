Built on Gatsby. Here's the basics.

## Develop

When working locally:

```powershell
npm run develop
```

Will run it on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
Graph data is on [localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql) [[docs]](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

## Deploy

When ready to get onto github:

```powershell
npm run deploy
```

It'll publish to github automatically but you have to commit+push the source yourself.
